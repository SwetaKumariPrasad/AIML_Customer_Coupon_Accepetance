# AIML_Customer_Coupon_Accepetance
Distinguish between customers who accepted a coupon versus those that did not.

# Project Overview
This project explores various options/factors/conditions whether a driver will accept a coupon delivered to their phone. The coupon is for a Bar, Coffee House, Restraunt near their destination. The dataset is from UCI Machine Learning repository. The goal is to identify the characteristics and behaviors of customers who are likely to accept coupons, thereby providing actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

# Objectives

* Explore and visualize the acceptance rates of coupons.

* Identify demographic and behavioral factors that influence coupon acceptance.

* Develop hypotheses to explain observed patterns.

* Provide actionable insights for targeted marketing.

# Dataset Description

* The dataset includes user attributes (e.g., gender, age, income), contextual attributes (e.g., weather, time, passenger), and coupon details.

* Responses are labeled as Y = 1 for coupon acceptance and Y = 0 for rejection.

# Key Features Analyzed:

* Age

* Income Level

* Marital Status

* Passenger Type

* Time of Day

* Weather Condition

* Driving Destination

# Tech Stack & Libraries Used

* Python for data analysis and visualization.

* Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.

* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations.

* Plotly for interactive graphs.

# Next Steps & Recommendations

* Expand analysis to other coupon categories (e.g., restaurants, bars).

* Investigate combined factors like Income + Age or Marital Status + Time of Day.

* Build predictive models to forecast coupon acceptance.
